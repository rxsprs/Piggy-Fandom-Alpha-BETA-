    <h2>House Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>The House is the first chapter of Piggy.

        Character
        In this chapter, Piggy is the bot skin. Little Brother originally played the role as the bot for Chapters 1 to 4, but in an update, the bot skin changed to Piggy.

        Overview
        This map is based on Granny's house, however it has its differences. Main one being how much larger it is. House is the first chapter of Piggy. The Player is introduced to most of the main items of the game, including keys, safes, a pistol, ammo, vents, locked doors, hammers, wrenches, and a key code.

        Appearance
        The House is a three-story building most likely owned by the Piggy family. Its layout is similar to that of the house in Granny, with multiple exceptions and changes around the map, especially in the attic. Each floor appears to be made with a different material/color:

        Attic: Blue Wood.
        Second floor: Green Wood.
        First floor: Brown Wood.
        Upper Basement: Concrete.
        Lower Basement: Brick.
        The house contains a secret passageway that can be unlocked by breaking the wooden boards bolted on the vent leading to it. It runs under the house out to the backyard. It has two exit/entrance points: a vent in the upper basement and an opening behind the shed house.

        Cut-scene
        The cut-scene shows the player arriving at Piggy's house looking for Georgie. Immediately after exiting the car, the player hears an "oink" sound, and Piggy knocks the player out before they could figure out what was going on. Once again, similar to Granny, Piggy traps the player in the bedroom. The goal is to exit through the front door which is locked in many different ways.

        Transcript

        Trivia
        The House is one of the biggest maps in the game.
        This is one of the three maps where the protagonist is alone, along with Carnival and Distorted Memory.
        It is possible to die from falling in this chapter when you are upstairs crossing the plank.
        The start of the intro cutscene originally read "George Pig" instead of "Georgie Piggy".
        This change was made by MiniToon due to copyright reasons.
        This is one of three maps with edited intro cut-scenes, the others being Station and Gallery.
        This is one of the chapters that have a relevant bot skin, the other being Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 8, Chapter 10 and Chapter 11.
        It's possible for the Player and Piggy to jump through the window while being outside by constantly jumping against the kitchen counter next to it.
        For R6 (Piggies especially) and R15 characters, the player should shake their camera left and right (while in first person) rapidly while holding the spacebar key (Jump button for mobile users).
        There are two remakes of this map made by MiniToon: Sketch's home and Distorted Memory.
        This and School are the only maps to use gears.
        If lucky enough, the player doesn't have to use the plank to complete the map.
        The house used to have a lot of Peppa Pig pictures, but they were removed and replaced with blank pictures because of copyright reasons.
        The mud puddle in the basement is a reference in Peppa Pig that the pigs like to jump into the mud puddles.
        There is a bug in the game that occurs when you go up the stairs and there is (like a kind of speed artifact) that takes you around the contour and without the plank you end up falling to the floor.
        The bot in this map was originally Little Brother, but was later changed to Piggy.</p>
    <h2> Station Chapter2</h2>
    <p>The Station is the second chapter of Piggy.

        Character
        As of the Chapter 5 update, the Mother bot skin is used, replacing Little Brother.

        Overview
        The Station is a police station/prison containing three floors. This chapter contains regular tools found in House, like keys, a wrench and hammer, however, there is no key-code card. It also introduces two new specialized items, batteries and the gas, and a new obstacle, the acid. The station is the player’s place of occupation.

        Appearance
        The Station has a basement under the prison cells and is linked to the main area of the police station by a wooden plank placed over an acid canal. The first floor is the main police station combined with prison cells behind it. The second floor only consists the upper prison cells and likely the police commissioner or chief’s room.

        Cutscene
        When the Player arrives at the Station, a speaker (Doggy) calls from above, announcing that a monster,Mother, is roaming around the station and tells the Player to go to the garage to flee from the station.

        Transcript
        Prologue,
        Player: "Hello? Is anyone here at the station?"
        Doggy: "Attention! A monster is in the station! Get to the garage now!"

        Round Starts,
        Player: "Another monster?! I need to get to the garage!

        (Entering the garage)",
        Doggy: "Hurry! Find some gas so we can get out of here!"

        Epilogue

        New

        (Doggy is driving on the road)

        Doggy: "You’re lucky I showed up on my day off."
        Player: "And you’re lucky I brought gas, Doggy."
        Doggy: "Touché, (Player username)."
        Doggy: "Man, we seriously need to find out what’s going on."
        Player: "I know, I’ve started to see these things all over the place."
        Doggy: "We need to find out what caused this. You haven’t lost your past detective skills, have you?"
        Player: "I hope not, I think I could use them better now than ever before."
        Doggy: "Hey, (Player username)?"
        Player: "Yeah, Doggy?"
        Doggy: "How much gas was in that can you give?"

        Trivia
        Several notes in the station, which were theorized to be written by Doggy, show that the other officers left him behind.
        The Station is one of the largest maps.
        This chapter is the only map that has additional requirements past opening the main door to escape.
        Piggy can walk on the acid.
        This map looks more like a prison than a police station.
        Station was the first map to feature the gasoline container, the second map being Outpost.
        This is the only map to have the plank already placed for you.
        This was also the first map to feature the batteries, the second being Plant, the third is Alley, the fourth is Store, and the fifth is Refinery.
        Little Brother was originally the bot for this map, yetMiniToon was planning on the player meeting George piggy, therefore, he could not be infected before you met him un-infected.</p>
    <h2>Gallery Chapter 3</h2>
    <p>Gallery is the third chapter of Piggy. It was created by IK3As.
        Character
        As of Chapter 5 update, the Piggy bot skin used is Father. Foxy and Teacher used to be in the intro cutscene, but they were removed due to lore in later updates.

        Overview
        Gallery may seem extremely small from the middle of the lobby. However, there are multiple rooms, passageways and openings that expand the boundaries of the maps. Despite the ability for players to fall at certain areas, there is no fall damage in Gallery, unlike House, Forest, and City. Also, there is a connection from the Gallery to the Alleys.

        Appearance
        Gallery is a rather small map that is somewhat a cross between an art gallery and a museum since there are artifacts for display such as the dinosaur skeleton exhibit and the fabergé eggs.

        Cutscene
        The Player and Doggy are shown cornered by multiple infected characters after the car runs out of fuel. They have no other choice except for fleeing to the gallery.

        Transcript
        Prologue
        Doggy: "We're out of gas, and completely surrounded!"
        Player: "Looks like we'll have to go through the gallery!"

        (Once the game starts)
        Player: "Some of those monsters looked familiar..."
        Epilogue New

        (The cutscene pans out to you and doggy, outside of the gallery)

        Player: "They just don’t stop coming after us, do they?"
        Doggy: "I don’t get it. But hey, it’s nothing we can’t handle."
        Doggy: "After all, remember when we made that arrest in the alley, way before this?"
        Player: "Yeah, but we weren’t arresting these... things! They don’t do anything but attack us."
        Doggy: "Listen, (Player username). You’re a good person. Even in desperate times, you held on to your morality."
        Doggy: "It’s the people like you who succeed. As long as you stay who you are, you’ll get to where you need to be."
        Player: "You’re right, Doggy. I can’t let the situation make me lose sight of who I am."
        Doggy: "Good! Now, let’s find someplace safe. We’ll have time to think of what to do."
        Player: "Sounds like a plan."

        Trivia
        Cutscene
        Teacher and Foxy were formerly in the intro cutscene, however, they were removed since they are part of the lore as of Chapter 8 (Carnival) and 5 (School).
        In the intro cutscene, you are in a car with Doggy in front of the Gallery, surrounded by the infected. It appears that you are in front of the main entrance. However, during the ending cutscene, you talk to Doggy and escape through a narrow alley from what seems as a rear or side exit. However, when you are in the Gallery itself, there appears to be only one exit. This is one of the few strange contradictions in Piggy.
        There used to be a missing poster of George Pig in the gallery, but it was removed due to copyright reasons.
        Doggy mentions making an arrest in an alley during the Epilogue, which was most likely during Alleys - Chapter 1.
        People like to do a glitch in the map.
        Gameplay
        This is the first playable location not to feature the pistol and ammo. This is due to the fact that you can give a bone to Doggy to knock out Piggy with.
        However, in Traitor mode the pistol will spawn because it would be unfair for the other players if it did not.
        To some people, this map is the hardest to escape due to the small size.
        Unlike House, Forest or City, you will not die from falling from a height.
        The bot in this map sort of makes sense, since Father appears in the cutscene and most likely follows you inside.
        This is the only map to use the Red, Blue, and Green Porcelain Eggs.
        This is the first map that where a player can use a Friendly NPC to knock out Piggy.

        As of the Chapter 5 update, the bot for Forest is Sheepy and Doggy is the supporting bot. During the Halloween Event, Mr. Stitchy is also an additional bot to the chapter, making the chapter more challenging.

        Appearance
        The Forest is most likely the darkest map in Piggy.(This is not including the Winter Holiday event, as the snow makes it look lighter). To make the map brighter, street lamps and a campfire have been placed. Players are introduced to a new torch that can be lit up by the campfire and more generators to be turned on by the wrench.

        Cutscene
        Four weeks after the events of Gallery, the Player and Doggy are at a forest and a camp. The Player and Doggy talk before Doggy decides they should get some rest. Afterward, Doggy was forced to drink or willingly drinks Substance 128 and turns into an infected.

        Halloween Event
        During the Halloween Event, players are able to do a bonus challenge. That challenge is to find five candles scattered around the map and lure Mr. Stitchy into the cave to a mysterious portal. The locations for the five candles are in the tent, behind the unfinished cabin (or Piggy Spawn), in the tower, behind the far left cabin, and in the cave. Now go to the unfinished cabin and light up all five candles with the lit torch, it will summon Mr. Stitchy. As seen above in the first sentence, you need to lure Mr. Stitchy into the cave to complete the challenge. The easiest way to do this is to walk behind the portal, then wait for Mr. Stitchy to fall in. Once you do lure him into the portal, you will earn his skin. (Although you do not need to complete the map as well)

        Trivia
        Cutscene
        During the first cutscene, Doggy uses the Minecraft Wolf barking sound effect.
        It is strange that there is glass breaking sound (from the bottle containing Substance 128) as after the cutscene, the empty bottle lies on the ground, perfectly in one piece, unless the bottle has a crack that can't be seen.
        When the Player says "Doggy? Where are you?", it may refer to the line "Scooby-Doo! Where are you?" from the classic kids' morning show Scooby-Doo.
        Gameplay
        This is the first map to include an extra bot.
        The skin of the bot on this map is Sheepy (as of the Chapter 5 update).
        This ties in with the previous chapter's cutscene, as she may have followed the player to the forest.
        If the player tries to jump from one stair to the next one on the tower, it will result in instant death, the reason why is unknown.
        This is the second time fall damage has been incorporated in a map, the previous being House, and the next being City.
        The outro cutscene place can actually be seen if the player goes up the tower and looks near the exit.
        Forest is one of the four maps to have a small part of it in the second part of Plant, the other three being Carnival, Metro and School.
        Forest, Carnival - Chapter 8, City - Chapter 9, and Outpost - Chapter 11 are the only chapters to be set mainly outside.
        It is the first map to take place outside in the piggy storyline.</p>

        The School is the fifth chapter of Piggy. It was released on March 6th, 2020.

        Character
        The bot skin used for this map is Teacher.

        Overview
        This map is made to imitate a typical school in America. School contains most basic items found in other chapters.

        Appearance
        The school is a rather big map. Although it only has two levels (not including the sewers), each level has a large area of space, containing many rooms and classrooms.

        Cutscene
        Prologue
        The Player is near a school with the walkie-talkie from the previous chapter. The person speaking on the walkie-talkie introduces himself as Mr. P, and has the player to save Bunny from the school and then go to the sewers to meet him.

        Epilogue
        Once the Players have entered the sewers, Mr. P greets them, but the Player does not feel well and passes out. They then wake up lying on a stretcher as Bunny follows them, and the player hallucinates Doggy.

        Trivia
        This is one of the 5 maps that have bot skins that actually makes sense to be in the map, the others being in House - Chapter 1, Hospital - Chapter 6, Carnival - Chapter 8, Mall - Chapter 10, and Outpost - Chapter 11
        Before this map was officially released, MiniToon accidentally released it early, a few hours before it was officially released.
        In Forest, the exit gate can be assumed to lead to the school, which links the two chapters.
        Skelly appears in one of the classrooms but has no function as he is just an idle mannequin.
        Written on a chalkboard in one of the classrooms is the text, "Z wvvc vmvipkyzex Z uf. Z tre'k tfekifc dp rtkzfej. Z tre'k yvcg dpjvcw. Dp dzeu pvccj wfi yvcg slk dp sfup ufvj efk rxivv. Z nzjy kyv nficu nflcu leuvijkreu." When decoded properly, the message says, "I feel everything I do. I can't control my actions. I can't help myself. My mind yells for help, but my body does not agree. I wish the world would understand."
        This message was supposedly written by the Teacher before she was fully infected.
        The school is the only map to contain the book, and it functions similarly to a key.
        School is one of the four maps to have a small part of it in the 2nd part of Plant, the other 3 being Carnival, Forest and Metro.
        This is one of the three maps to not feature a Plank. The other two are Metro and Outpost.
        This is the second map to have gears, the other is House - Chapter 1.
        This is the second chapter to introduce a helpful NPC without the need of a cutscene, the first is Station - Chapter 2.</p>
    <h2> Chapter 6 Hospital</h2>
    <p>Hospital is the sixth chapter of Piggy Book 1. It was created by MiniToon.

        Overview
        In this map, players must escape Beary by reaching the roof of the Hospital.

        Bunny appears once again to aid the player in their escape by stunning the Piggy. In addition to Bunny, the gun also appears along with a helpful NPC for the first time.

        Players are introduced to a new item—keycards and test tubes.

        Hospital is also known to have the third most items in a chapter (after Mall and City).

        Appearance
        Hospital mimics a regular hospital. However, at the time you gain consciousness, the hospital appears to be have been abandoned, with only you, other players, Bunny and Beary. The hospital has white walls, with lines and frames of red and black running along it.

        Cutscene
        The prologue shows the player waking up in a hospital after the events in the ending from Chapter 5. Bunny then tells the player that Mr. P will meet them at the rooftop.

        At the ending when the Player and Bunny make it to the rooftop, they don't see a helicopter. Then Bunny suggests that they take another escape route and the Player agrees. Later, as the player asks if she is coming, Bunny finds a note by Mr. P, saying he has left and that he had to do it for their own good.

        The alternative escape route is later to be revealed as going to the Metro.

        Trivia
        This is the first place to feature both a pistol/ammo and Bunny's carrot, the next being City and then Mall.
        Even though Doggy was shown in Chapter 5's ending, he doesn't appear in this map. A note in the spawn room confirms that the Doggy in Chapter 5's ending was just a hallucination and that Doggy has most likely died, disappeared, or become infected.
        This may mean that Doggy is possibly still in the Forest, or he had gone elsewhere.
        The skin of the bot on this map is Beary.
        This is one of the 4 bot skins that actually makes sense to be in the map, the others being the bot skins in Chapter 1, Chapter 5, Chapter 8, Chapter 10, and Chapter 11
        For the first time in the game, you are not able to fall off the space beside the plank (placed).
        This makes it easier for the Piggy to layer effective traps and/or camp
        This is the first chapter to feature keycards to access rooms.
        This and Chapter 12 are the only chapters to not require a wrench for escaping.</p>
    <h2> Chapter 7 Metro </h2>
    <p>Metro is the seventh chapter of Piggy. IK3As helped build this map.

        Overview
        Metro is a big map and its layout can be rather confusing to players. It has three stairways leading to the basement area and multiple hallways, Metro is also connected to the Store - Chapter 2 (Piggy: Book 2), As the Garage Door on the Vending Machine room is connected to the Parking lot on the Book 2 Store Map.

        Players are introduced to a new item: coins. There is also a new feature; a vending machine that contains a blue keycard. To deposit it, it requires two coins.

        Appearance
        Metro resembles a typical metro station. It has one platform with a temporarily immovable train (until you unlock and power up the train). It has a brown and dirty basement hallway with multiple miscellaneous rooms. There is also a ticketing office at the platform (not functional, but may contain item(s) in it). The bot for the metro is Zompiggy.

        Cutscene
        The cutscene shows that Bunny is tired and wants to rest. She lent her crossbow to the player so that they could defend themselves and repair the train.

        The ending shows the fixed train and the player telling Bunny that they can leave. Bunny then says that Mr. P. gave her a potion (Substance 128) and that it would turn her into an infected. Then the player leaves without Bunny, who later becomes infected(shown in Chapter 12 credits).

        Transcript
        Prologue
        Bunny: We're almost out of there. I just need to rest a little...
        Player: Don't worry Bunny, we're getting out of here!

        Player: Bunny! The train is working now!
        Player: Bunny? Are you all alright?
        Bunny: Mr. P. gave me a potion. I drank it.
        Bunny: I didn't know it would soon turn me into...
        Player: You can still come with me. We can find him.
        Bunny: No, you need to go without me.
        Player: Bunny, I-
        Bunny: Go now... I'll hold those monsters off for long as I can.
        Player: Well... goodbye Bunny.
        Bunny: Good Luck, (Player username).

        Trivia
        This map, Mall - Chapter 10, City - Chapter 9, Plant - Chapter 12, and Outpost- Chapter 11 are the only maps that have both keys and a key card.
        Metro is the 1st Map that uses Vending Machines, the second being Plant.
        Metro is one of the four maps to have a small part of it in the 2nd part of Plant, the other 3 being Carnival, Forest and School.
        This is one of the Three maps to have coins, the others being Mall-Chapter 10 for the Arcade Game and Plant-Chapter 12 for the carnival hammer
        All three require two coins, but in Mall, you outright get the white key
        This is the first map to contain acid the second being Plant.
        This is one of the six maps to not feature the plank. The others are School, Outpost, Alleys, Store, Refinery and Safe Place.
        Metro is the first and only map that allows the player to use an NPC's weapon instead of a gun or the NPC using their own weapon.
        The metal door seen in metro is also seen in Store - Chapter 2</p>
    <h2> Chapter 8 Carnival (Ending of second story)</h2>
    The Carnival is the 8th chapter of Piggy. It was created by MiniToon with some help from IK3As.

    The Carnival is a rather big map, although it has only one actual level (the circus tent has a higher platform, which might be the only "second level" in the map). The Carnival is a cross between a carnival (the map contains carnival booths and a circus tent) and an amusement park (the map also contains a roller coaster ride and ferris wheel). Clowny is the bot skin for this map.

    Cutscene
    The Player is traveling through the train from the previous chapter until they go into a carnival trying to get revenge on Mr. P, hoping to find him here.

    When the player goes into a room (the end point of the chapter) they try and find Mr P. but instead find two other characters, Zizzy and Pony. Then Zizzy and Pony greet the player while the player also greets them. It is revealed that Zizzy and Pony were trying to look for survivors where they are in a safe place until Foxy is about to kill the player. Then Pony warns the player and knocks out Foxy. Then Zizzy and Pony take the player with them to the next chapter.

    Epilogue
    Player: "Mr. P., I am here to- Who are you?"
    Pony: "Uhhh... Zizzy, Are they infected?"
    Zizzy: "Pony, the infected don't talk."
    Pony: "Right, I knew that!"
    Zizzy: "I'm Zizzy, and this is my friend Pony."
    Player: "I'm (Player username). What are you doing here?"
    Zizzy: "We came here to look for survivors. We've got a safe place."
    Pony: "Oh, look, they've got a friend too."

    (Camera shows Foxy behind the player)
    Zizzy: "That's no friend, that's one of them!"
    Pony: "Don't worry, I got this!"

    (Pony knocks out Foxy)
    Player: "Thanks, that was a close one!"
    Zizzy: "Let's bring you back with us, this place is dangerous."

    Trivia
    The map was predicted to be a Circus/Amusement Park, due to a picture MiniToon shown in one his Twitter posts.
    This marks the debut of Zizzy and Pony.
    This also breaks the streak of Bunny appearing.
    The Carnival represents Potato City from a Peppa Pig episode.
    This chapter somewhat explains the reasoning of Foxy's circus-like music and also possibly his backstory.
    This chapter currently has one of the longest endings, as being the last one alive and escaping will result in not being able to vote for anything in the next round.
    This title is shared with City, Mall, Outpost and Plant.
    Ms. P makes a cameo during the ending cutscene.
    This chapter is the first account of The Silver Paw in notes.
    Carnival is one of the four maps to have a small part of it in the secnd part of Plant, the other three being Metro, Forest and School.
    Carnival is one of the five maps that have more than one Piggy without the Infection or Player gamemode. The other four being Forest, City, Mall, and Plant.
    This chapter is MiniToon's favorite.
    This is the first chapter to include the Water Gun, and the Toy Hammer, and currently the only chapter to include the former.
    In Infection, the player does not become Piggy if killed by Foxy in the cage.
    Forest - Chapter 4, Carnival, City - Chapter 9, and Outpost - Chapter 11 are the only chapters to be set mainly outside, not inside.
    It is the second map to have a secondary bot, the other one being Forest before it.Chapter 8 is the easiest map on piggy.
    <h2>Chapter 9 City (Begining of Final Story)</h2>
    <p>City is the 9th chapter of Piggy. It was created by MiniToon and IK3As.
        Character
        Elly serves as the main bot of this map, along with Grandmother as the secondary bot.

        Overview
        City contains the second most amount of items in a map, only beaten by the Mall map. Players are reintroduced to basic items (keys and cards) and also introduced to new items like the Dynamite and Fire Extinguisher. It is one of the biggest maps and is the second tallest map (counting the roof). The tallest is The Safe Place.

        Appearance
        City consists of two main buildings, the larger abandoned hotel and the smaller (also abandoned) office building, Elly Enterprises (likely to be where Elly worked before she became infected), and the small store near the hotel, Grandma Piggy's Poutine (most likely where Grandmother worked before she was infected). There is also a road with many abandoned rusty cars on it.

        Cutscene
        The Player is with Zizzy and Pony from the carnival. The three are on a city building overlooking Pony and Zizzy's safe place. However, the gate leading to the safe place is locked, so the player has to unlock it.

        In the end, the group of 3 chat with each other about what they were doing before all of this along with how they are going to stop Mr. P from spreading around the potions. Then they hear something that hit the dumpster from behind in the distance, and you and Zizzy check it out. Pony stays behind, telling you and Zizzy to stay safe.

        Zizzy: "They'll be pretty surprised that we found someone."

        Pony: "I was trying to become an optometrist just like my father."
        Zizzy: "And I was a fencing coach. I even taught my little sisters. I'm so relieved that they're safe here with me."
        Pony: "Yeah..."
        Zizzy: "How'd you end up at the carnival? I heard you were looking for Mr. P."
        Player: "Mr. P's been giving out potions... they turn you into the infected. I need to stop him from doing this."
        Zizzy: "You should at least stay here for a little. We can help you find him."

        (Something hits the dumpster)
        Pony: "W-What was that?"
        Player: "I think someone's watching us... I'll go check it out."

        Trivia
        When playing Player + Bot, a picture of Mrs. P can be found under the purple car. It can only be obtained by one player and despawns if you pick something else up, and allows you to get the true ending in the finale.
        This map had the most items available in the entire game until Mall - Chapter 10 was released.
        Pony says that he wants to become an optometrist just like his dad, correlating to the fact that Mr. Pony is an optometrist in the Peppa Pig series.
        Zizzy mentions her little sisters who are Zee and Zuzy.
        This chapter, Forest - Chapter 4, Carnival - Chapter 8, Mall - Chapter 10, Outpost - Chapter 11, and Plant - Chapter 12 (Finale) are the only chapters with extra infected characters.
        This is the first chapter where the bots can wait for players near a door, this door being the door on the left side of Elly Enterprises on the side of the exit.
        This is the third time fall damage is incorporated in a map, the other two being House and Forest.
        This is the first chapter where it is possible to have two bots that follow you, however, the extra Grandmother bot is very slow, which makes it easier to avoid her.
        This is also the first time that an extra bot that can infect you if Infection is selected.
        Because of her slowness, she can appear when the player least expects it.
        In addition, when a player she is chasing goes up the stairs in the hotel building, she often goes up the opposite set of stairs that the player is going up.
        Unlike regular Piggy bots, the Grandmother bot spawns immediately when the round starts.
        She spawns in Elly Enterprises on the 2nd floor, this can be proved by the fact that either of the doors of the building's sides will be open even though no one has gone there yet and by the paths, she takes while coming down to the hotel building.
        This is the first chapter that has an NPC that doesn't knock out the Piggy when given food, that being Pony.
        Because Grandmother always knows where everyone is, the Piggy can use her to their advantage while trying to find someone.
        If Grandmother is attacked by Zizzy, the door is closed in the face or if she is fired by the pistol she will return at the speed of a normal Bot.
        This may suggest that her slowness is really a game bug
        The explosion from the dynamite does not hurt players' health. It takes about 4 seconds for the dynamite to blow up.
        Along with that, the dynamite's noise makes the TNT blowing up sound from the Minecraft game.
        This is the first map not to feature the white padlock and its corresponding white key, the second being Outpost - Chapter 11
        Forest - Chapter 4, Carnival - Chapter 8, City, Outpost - Chapter 11 ,and Winter Holiday are the only chapters to be set mainly outside, not inside.
        The city’s actual name is, “Lucella”.Chapter 9 is also known as the hardest map in Piggy Book 1!</p>
    <h2> Chapter 10 Mall</h2>
    <p>Mall is the 10th chapter of Piggy. The map was created by MiniToon.

        Character
        Robby is the main bot skin for this map, while Mousy acts as an extra bot in the vent area to stop vent camping (staying in the vent) by killing players through a vent if they get too close to her, however there is a spot where Mousy can't get the player. Zizzy can knock out Piggy for 20 seconds if given grass.

        Overview
        The Mall is a small two-story mall with many different stores, which include the following:

        "The Aye-Aye Arcade".
        "Birdy Bank".
        "Kitty's Kitchen".
        An unnamed clothing area.
        An unnamed sports area.
        An unnamed "kitchen" area.
        There are also 2 security detectors and 2 pairs of non-operating escalators.

        Appearance
        The Mall is a rather small map. It is a two-story mall with multiple shops (non-functional) and two pairs of escalators (non-operational) that act as stairs in this map, and a large vent in the middle.

        Zizzy: You know this kid?
        Player: This is the person I was looking for. Why'd you run, Georgie?
        Georgie: After my family visited the hospital, they acted weird... and scary. I came here, looking for grandma. But everyone looked scary... so I hid.

        Trivia
        If you look at the vault door inside the Bank, you will see that it is one that represents the one from Jailbreak.
        This then became a crossover event where players had to go through a Laser Obby and reach the vault to get the Poley skin.
        This is the first appearance of George Piggy excluding him appearing on pictures.
        All bots on this map are broken in some way. For example, if Piggy (as a player) walks through lasers while being chased by Zizzy, Zizzy will instead take a detour.
        Even though Doggy and Bunny became infected on their third appearance, Zizzy and Pony have managed to avoid this.
        This is the first map that prevents vent campers, with Mousy in the vents being the reason. However, because Mousy often gets stuck or falls out of the vents, it is not entirely effective.
        In the ending cutscene, NPCs Giraffy and Mimi are seen, confirming they are not infected.
        One of the stores in the mall is called "Kitty's Kitchen", which is where Kitty must've worked before joining The Silver Paw.
        This also now makes Kitty canonical to the story.
        This is the second time an alarm indicator has been implemented into a map, the first being Forest with the Doggy NPC.
        This is the first time the current most expensive skin of the chapter release is the bot skin of the map, the second being the Outpost update.
        It's also the first time a skin that costs over 400 Piggy Tokens is used as the official bot skin.
        In this map, there are 3 pieces of grass to give to Zizzy, unlike the previous chapter, where there was only 2.
        This is the first time that lasers exist in a map since School.
        The Alarm Detectors are commonly mistaken to be lasers; they only alert Piggy of one's location.
        A laser blocks the vault in the bank (Birdy Bank), which is not harmful.
        This is the first, ever laser in the game that isn't harmful.
        This chapter now holds the record number of items in a map, scoring at 21.
        It is strange how George is able to lock himself in the room with the locks being outside it.
        Inside the bank vault, after the laser obby, there is a binary code that, when decoded, reads: We are upgrading the mall security protocol droids to protect it against intruders and the infected." This is a clue as to what Robby is based off.
        Robby is the bot in this map.
        This is the first and only chapter where two games did a crossover (Jailbreak and Piggy).
        This is also the first and only chapter to have an obby.
        The Mall chapter is actually quite small compared to a real mall.
        Like Forest - Chapter 4, Carnival - Chapter 8, City - Chapter 9, & Plant, the map features 2 bots.
        This is the only map to feature a bot that can crawl.
        It is the first chapter to also feature a bot that is not infected or alive.
        This chapter features the first appearance of George (not counting the posters of him in Station).</p>
    <h2> Chapter 11 Outpost</h2>
    <p>Outpost is the 11th chapter of Piggy. It was created by MiniToon and IK3As.

        Character
        Torcher plays the role of the primary bot for the Outpost. There are also extra bots, who are the Soldiers. They spawn through 3 separate different spawn holes in the ground. Both primary and extra bots are harmful, as they can kill you.

        Overview
        The Outpost is a military training area, containing a number of easter eggs regarding the storyline. This map contains a building joint containing the following facilities: sleeping quarters, a cafeteria, a meeting room, a workout area, a Medibay, Mr. P's base (the escape room), a strategy room, and even a tank. There are also spawn holes from where Soldiers climb out, and they do kill you if touched.

        Appearance
        The Outpost is like a training camp, with a floor level, a small second floor, and also some watchtowers and walls. There are some areas you would see in a training camp (Sleeping Quarters, Cafeteria, etc.) and there are holes in the ground where the Soldiers emerge from.

        Cutscene
        The cutscene begins with Zizzy and Pony walking up to the Outpost with you.

        Transcript

        Georgie: "I convinced them to play a game of hide and seek."
        Player: "Why did you follow us, Georgie?"
        Georgie: "I want to see the person who hurt my family."
        (Camera pans up behind Georgie to see a lot of infected Soldiers.)
        Pony: "Well, you've attracted quite the crowd..."
        Zizzy: "[Player Name], take Georgie with you in there. Pony and I will hold them off.
        Player: "Stay close to me, Georgie. I'll keep you safe."

        (Player & Georgie goes through.)
        Pony: "Zizzy, if we don't make it out of this, I just want to let you know..."
        Zizzy: "It's okay Pony, I already know."

        (Camera proceeds to display you, Georgie, and Cyborg Mr. P)
        Mr. P: "I've become a disaster. I tried to make things better... but ended up making them worse."
        The Player: "Mr. P! We've come to stop your evil plans!"
        Mr. P: "It... can't be...You two... aren't real. My mind is playing tricks on me. The people I let down are here to haunt me."
        Georgie: "What's he talking about?"
        Mr. P: "You two are dead! Leave me be!"
        Player: "We need to go after him."

        Trivia
        This chapter is the second chapter update to include both of the new skins not being based on Peppa Pig with the first being Chapter 7.
        This map's bot skin is the Torcher, who has a flamethrower weapon and is wearing a hazard suit.
        Confirmed by MiniToon, Chapter 11 is harder than Chapter 9.
        MiniToon stated that Chapter 11 was delayed due to some major bugs.
        In the ending cutscene, Zizzy and Pony have to fight many Soldiers.
        Zizzy walks around the map and defeats soldiers that spawn from holes. These soldiers occasionally walk around and can kill if ran into.
        This is the first time a friendly NPC doesn't require their respective item to attack an enemy.
        For some reason, the soldiers NPC in Outpost have a very small hitbox.
        Whereas, as a player wearing the soldier skin or the one's created in Piggy Build Mode have normal-sized hitboxes.
        Also included with this, this is the first map that has NPC Bots appear throughout the game.
        This is the first time Pony is used for stunning the Piggy. In his previous appearance in the City, he replaced the hammer's purpose.
        The epilogue hints at a relationship between Zizzy and Pony, however, it is unconfirmed.
        This is the first map that requires a keycard to be used on the exit door to escape.
        This is the second map that doesn't use the white key to escape.
        This is the second map that requires the fire extinguisher to escape, the first being City.
        This is the third map that doesn't require the hammer throughout the round, the first being City and the second being Mall.
        This is the first map that doesn't require the hammer nor the crowbar.
        It was also hinted that the fire extinguisher was making a return as an item from the fire emoji on a tweet by MiniToon.
        There is a ghost/shadow of Bunny in one of the towers, there is nothing known about it though.
        This is the first map where the blue keycard replaces the white key.
        This is the second map in which gasoline is needed (to power the tank). The first map was Station.
        This is one of the three maps to not feature a plank. The other two are Metro and School.
        Outpost and House are the only chapter to appear twice in the story (Outpost appears in the good ending of Chapter 12 and House appears in Distorted Memory).
        The Soldiers share the same AI as Foxy.
        Forest - Chapter 4, Carnival - Chapter 8, City - Chapter 9, and Outpost are the only chapters to be set mainly outside, not inside.
        This currently is the last chapter to feature an extra bot.
        Errors
        The tank knocked down the fence, and Soldier Holes are all absent from Chapter 12's good ending and True ending.</p>
    <h2> Chapter 12 Plant (Book 1 Finale)</h2>
    <p>Plant - Chapter 12 is the last chapter of Piggy: Book 1. It was released on May 24, 2020. After this chapter, the lore of Piggy continues with Piggy: Book 2 (not a separate game), which was released on September 12, 2020.

        Characters
        First Phase
        Badgy is the primary bot of the map. Along with that, Mr. P will help Badgy during both phases, as he will kill the player if they get too close to him. He is also able to shoot stunning bullets that lock on the target as well. After getting the TNT or dynamite to blow up the Plant, the chapter will move on to its second phase.

        Second Phase
        Mr. P and Badgy will continue to chase you in this phase. Hallucinations of Bunny and Doggy will begin in this phase, causing the player to get stunned if they accidentally walk into the hallucinations. "For You to Stay" by Mira K will start playing when you obtain the dynamite and will play until the phase is completed.

        Appearance
        First Phase
        The Plant is a circular complex with four walkways branching out from the circle. The four walkways are coloured orange, blue, green and red each. The hallways lead to different areas, in which some are bigger than the rest. At the very center, there is a marking for the Player to place the dynamite in the first phase.

        Second Phase
        The Plant turns into a combination of parts of past chapters, being Forest, School, Metro and Carnival. Note that not all past chapters appear in the second phase, contrary to popular believe. It is theorized the second phase doesn't exist and is a hallucination. There are also broken walls to enter the previous chapters , similar to the ones in distorted memory.

        Cutscene
        The cutscene begins with the player and Georgie chasing Mr. P. Afterwards, Mr. P becomes enraged and decides to pursue them. This leads to the need for the player to give a sentimental item to Mr. P in order to stop him from his cruel ambitions.

        After stopping him, Mr. P reflects on his actions, while George wishes to attack him to avenge his infected family. The Player then convinces him to stop, saying that if he hurts Mr. P, he is no better than him.

        Later, Mr. P says that he will fight off the remaining infected, which leaves the player to either go with George or to save Mr. P which will be decided at the end of the game.

        Save Mr. P (Bad Ending)
        If the player decides to save Mr. P, they will go up to him and try to help him, but end up getting hit by Badgy with a radioactive container. You then see your infected self standing over Mr. P's hat.

        Leave the Plant (Good Ending)
        If the player decides to leave the plant they will go back to the Outpost. During the daytime, it is revealed that Zizzy and Pony managed to defeat all the soldiers and thus, greet both the Player and George. The Player then reveals that they made Mr. P snap out of his actions and changed him. Afterward, the four have nowhere to go, hence, they wonder what they should do next. George then suggests searching for a cure for The Virus, so that virus victims can return back to their original state.

        True Ending
        To get the True Ending, first you must finish all of the chapters (in other Words, All The Badges) in Piggy you need to pick City - Chapter 9 and Player + Bot. Then, under one of the cars, Ms. P picture appears. In order to pick the picture up, you must have all badges except for the one awarded for completing the True Ending. Then, pick Plant as any game mode. As you beat the chapter, go do the method of Saving Mr. P. If you do the bad ending, Mr. P will tell you his story. After that, the same cutscene of the Good Ending plays. Note that all characters including Mr. P's hat in the credits are gone. You'll obtain the Mr. P skin.

        George: "Finally, you know we're real! Now, tell me what you did to my family."
        Mr. P: "They wanted to help me with my research...."
        George: "You took them away from me. You hurt them."
        George: "Now I am going to hurt you."
        Player: "George don't do it! If you hurt him, you are no better than him!"
        Player: "It would only turn you into what you hate most in him."
        George: "I guess you're right..."
        Mr. P: "... You need to leave now. It's not safe here."
        Player: "He's right, this place is infested."
        Mr. P: "I'll fight the infected until I drop, it's time I try to redeem myself."
        Player: "Good luck, Mr. P."

        Player: "We stopped Mr. P. He's no longer a threat."
        Zizzy: "Great job, I knew you could do it!"
        Pony: "I hate to ruin the moment, but... where do we go from here?"
        George: "I've got an idea..."
        George: "What if we look for a cure?"

        True Ending
        Mr. P: "I... I want to tell you my story, but you wouldn't believe me."
        Player: "Say it, Mr. P. I need to know what happened."
        Mr. P: "Then you must leave after... I'm afraid there isn't much time."
        (The screen fades to black)

        Mr. P: "I was developing a cure to the sickness my wife, Ms. P, had."
        Mr. P: "I put in all my time and money into saving her. I even rushed the doctors to test the supposed cure."
        Mr. P: "The doctors kept telling me that the sample was unstable, but I didn't listen and I needed volunteers."
        Mr. P: "Then came the kind Piggy family... all but George. They wanted to help."
        Mr. P: "The initial results were significant. They became stronger. I was overjoyed, so I gave it to Ms. P immediately."
        Mr. P: "She was getting better until we heard news that the Piggy family started becoming hostile."
        Mr. P: "I thought it had nothing to do with my cure, but eventually, Ms. P became aggressive, too."
        Mr. P: "The last time I saw her, she had red eyes. I had to stop her but didn't have the heart to, so I let her go."
        Mr. P: "I tried again to make cures. Then you came along, we found signs of the infection within you but you were still alive."
        Mr. P: "Before we could do more research, the hospital we were at was raided, and Bunny was attacked."
        Mr. P: "I gave her another rushed cure, thinking it would save her. I realized what I had done, and left you two."
        (The screen fades to black again) Mr. P: "There you have it. That is my selfish, sorrowful story."
        Player: "Thank you for telling me, Mr. P. We won't forget you."

        Trivia
        This is the first of the two maps that does not have an escape door the second is the Winter Holiday map
        MiniToon replied to a fan who asked for a hint for Chapter 12 which was a light bulb (💡) emoji. He also gave hints of a dynamite/firecracker (🧨) and a high voltage (⚡) emoji on a different tweet.
        On May 25, 2020, MiniToon released the first hint; a question mark.
        On May 26, 2020, MiniToon released the second hint, a quote that goes: "Take this with you. Remember me by it. Don't lose this, too."
        On May 27, 2020, MiniToon released the third hint that has four squares, and the bottom left square is shaded.
        Chapter 12 was released late as Minitoon said in a tweet, "The bad news is I may need to delay Chapter 12, as I am actually moving houses, so I'll be really busy packing. I hope you all understand.
        Because the walk cycle of an angry Mr. P was released, people theorized that he may be a bot, and/or therefore a skin.
        Billy, Badgy, and Mr. P are skins added to the game during this update.
        In an interview with MiniToon, he gave three hints at the ending of Chapter 12: Stay, Illusions, and Choose.
        As MiniToon has said in a reply to ThinkNoodles, Chapter 12 will not be added to the 100 player version of Piggy as it "won't quite work with 100 players, after all". This raised quite a lot of questions about the anatomy and possible complexity chapter.
        This may be because of the fact that there are three different endings and that the Good and Bad endings are shown by a decision of the Player.
        This had also led people to theorize that the gameplay of the chapter may be similar to Distorted Memory.
        MiniToon tweeted a date along with a picture of the Piggy Family before they were infected. This date is "Sunday 2:00 PM MST", which was the date and time of Chapter 12's release.
        The song For You To Stay by Mira K will start playing once a player gains access to the TNT. However, if you don't place the dynamite in the center of the map, an instrumental version of the song will play until you place it. When you do, Mira K will begin singing the song when you enter the Boss Battle or "Part 2" of the chapter.
        The song Angel by Emma Duncan is played in the end credits.
        This chapter was the first and only chapter to have more than one ending.
        If you press the skip button after giving Mr. P the picture of Ms. P, you won't be able to the choose any ending, instead, you will be brought back to the menu.
        The Good and True Endings were the first times we could see the daylight, the others being Alleys - Chapter 1 (Piggy: Book 2) and Refinery - Chapter 3 (Piggy: Book 2).
        The Mr. P skin is achieved by completing the True Ending.
        The True Ending is the only ending that the first step is found in City - Chapter 9 and is the first chapter to have multiple steps for an ending.
        The portrait of Mrs. P is probably placed in city due to the fact that there is a Mrs. P Easter egg in the building.
        Chapter 12 is the first chapter where you have to do certain steps to get a specific ending.
        Despite giving Mr. P the photo of his wife, he never mentions you giving it to him.
        Chapter 12 has the largest number of characters appearing out of all the chapters.
        Chapter 12 also has the largest number of bots.
        The player likely hallucinates Bunny and Doggy due to taking a blast from the dynamite.
        George, as a helpful NPC, doesn't teleport to the second phase of the chapter.
        This is the only map in which a white key is needed to open a safe rather than a door.
        This is the second map to feature batteries.
        This is the only Chapter in which George can be used to knock out Piggy.
        However, for some reason, George won't knock out Mr. P.
        When you are in between George and Mr. P, waiting to choose an ending, if you look up, there is a full moon and and a black sky. However, if the true ending or the good ending is chosen, you find that Zizzy (NPC) and Pony (NPC) has survived, in the middle of the day.
        This is the only map to have four bots (six, if Player+Bot is selected and if Piggy places down a Tombstone Trap)
        This happens in other secondary bots like Forest (Doggy), Carnival (Foxy), and Outpost (Soldier).
        If Infection Mode is chosen, and a player is killed by Mr. P, the player will not respawn as Piggy.
        That may be because Mr. P. isn't infected.
        The Bad Ending has the player's legs and Mr. P's hat. The Good Ending has Mr. P.'s hat only. The True Ending has nothing.
        It is possible that the player killed Mr. P in the Bad Ending.
        This is the first map to require giving an item to an NPC rather than using a white key on an escape door.
        This is the first time an item can be given to a bot.
        This is the first time George is a helpful NPC.
        The maps shown in the second stage are significant to the player's past.
        The Forest is when Doggy becomes infected.
        The School is where the Player meets Bunny.
        The Metro is where Bunny becomes infected.
        The Carnival is where the Player meets both Pony and Zizzy.
        This chapter has the second longest ending, the first being Store.</p>
    <h1> Piggy Fandom Second Section (Book 2)</h2>
        <h2> Alleys Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Alleys is the first chapter of Piggy: Book 2 and the 13th chapter of Piggy overall. It was released on September 12, 2020.

            Character
            Rash acts as the main bot in this map. With Officer Doggy being the Helpful NPC.

            Overview
            Alleys is a handful of buildings that make up a group of alleyways. The Buildings Included in this map are: Unnamed Restaurant, Unnamed Hotel, Daisy's TV's, Leo's Laundromat, and Willow's Hideout. In this map it introduces us to three new tools that replace the Hammer, Wrench, and Code, those being the Screwdriver, Mop, and Scissors. Which take care of the Screw Doors, Water Puddles, And Caution Tape Respectively, this is also the first map where there is a random code that the player has to find the numbers for said code around to map. The Alleys seems to be Willow's Place Of occupation. Outside the alleyways is a street. During the beginning cutscene, when the camera turns to face the player, the silhouette of a figure that has a red and white eye, and looks suspiciously like George, can be seen across the street at another alleyway, looking at you and doggy.

            How to Get the Tombstone Trap
            Players need to find bones located around the map. There are a total of six pieces in total (two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head). There is a bone located in the restaurant behind a chair, and another one in the hotel Lobby behind a pillar near the glass doors. There is one in the room next to Rash's spawn in the small room with a table and a chair, and one more in the electronics room. The skeleton's torso is in the washing room and the head is located in the room by the coded exit in the room that has to be unlocked with a screwdriver. Once all the pieces of the skeleton are found, a rose will spawn in the room with a puddle of water on top of the plant, which the players have to pick up and then click on the hand of the skeleton which sits in the corner of the outside of the hotel hobby, and players will earn the Tombstone Traps.

            Doggy: Alright Detective, you better be right about her being here.
            Player: My investigation led me to this place, I'm sure she's here.
            (Game starts.)
            Doggy: Let's make this arrest quick, then!

            Doggy: Willow, you are under arrest for stealing food and other supplies from all over the city!
            Willow: I was only trying to feed my family, please!
            Player: You know the laws, Willow. I'm sorry.
            (Rash walks up from behind.)
            Willow: Stand down, Rash. It's not worth it.
            Rash: What? Why? They'll take us away!
            Doggy: We'd rather do that then take you out.
            Rash: Grr... you haven't seen the last of us!
            (Doggy and The player walk away.)
            Player: This really doesn't feel right.
            Doggy: I know what you mean. Unfortunately it's the way things have to be.
            Player: But.. isn't there anything we can do about it?
            Doggy: We all have a role to play, (Player's Name).
            Doggy: We do thing because we have to, not because we want to.
            Doggy: Now let's get out of here.
            (Doggy leaves)
            Doggy: Are you coming, (Player's Name)?

            Player: Huh? Where?
            Mimi: Remember that old radio we found from one of our supply runs?
            Player: What about it? Can we get it working?
            Mimi: Yep! We just need to find some batteries for it.
            Zizzy: Pony and I are going to the store to get some. Did you want to come along?
            Player: Sure, let's go!

            Trivia
            This chapter indeed happened before the main story, as proven during Gallery's epilogue and the fact it is presented as a flashback.
            It is revealed the disease Ms. P has is called Linnaeoma. A note near the orange door outside reveals it, as well as revealing the flashback took place in Lucella.
            In Leo's Landromat, there are binoculars watching the player.
            Players are able to glitch out of the map by going to the Leo Laundromat and crouching on the bench by the windows, then they can slowly jump up the building by moving up the windows and they should be able to reach the roof, and then they can make their way to the outside of the map and go through an alley where they can see the entrance of the Gallery from Chapter 3, however it is out of reach.
            The mysterious figure can be seen across the street, even in the game.</p>

            Prologue
            Zizzy: Remember, we’re going for batteries and getting out of here!

            Pony: Fine, but if I find any carrots, I’m taking them!

            (The round starts)

            Pony: ... The carrots here wouldn’t have expired by now, right?

            (When you meet Pony next to shelf)

            Pony: Hmmm... I think I could move this shelf if only I had some energy.

            (When you give 2 batteries to Zizzy)

            Zizzy: We have the batteries, now let's get to the exit!

            Epilogue
            Mimi: Aha, look who's back! I told you they'd be back before noon, Giraffy!

            Giraffy: A deal's a deal. Great, now I have to cook for the rest of the week...

            Player: We've got the batteries! Is the radio ready?

            Mimi: It sure is! Let's get this thing working!

            Later,

            Mimi: Here goes nothing... Hello? Can anyone hear me?

            Giraffy: Are you sure it's working?

            ???: ... Greetings, we can hear you. This is Settlement Six speaking. Who is this?

            Mimi: Oh! This is the Safe Place! How can I help?

            ???: ... We are looking for communities to trade with. We'd like to meet up.

            Mimi: Where should we go to find you?

            ???: ... Meet us at the Old Oak.

            Giraffy: It looks like we lost their signal.

            Mimi: We should meet them. We've been living together for months without seeing another survivor.

            Pony: I don't think this is a good idea. We don't know anything about them...

            Giraffy: Is this another one of your jokes, Pony?

            Pony: No, Giraffy, I mean it. We have no idea who these people are, and I don't have any reason to trust them.

            Zizzy: I agree. I don't think we should trust them. But, I still think we should check it out.

            Pony: What?! You can't go, Zizzy. We don't know who these people are.

            Zizzy: Pony, we know how to handle ourselves out there. If we get into trouble, we know how to get out of it.

            Player: Zizzy has a point. After all, you two fought an army of infected all by yourselves at the plant.

            Pony: I suppose so... I don't feel right about this, but I guess we should try anyways.

            Zizzy: Then it's time to see some new faces! Who is staying?

            Giraffy: I need to stay. I need to harvest as much as I can before winter comes.

            Mimi: I'm going to try and see if I can learn more about this radio.

            Zizzy: Then it looks like it's us three once more!

            Player: Let's go meet some survivors!

            [In the Old Oak,]

            Pony: Are you sure this is the place? We haven't seen anyone.

            ???: Well, well, well... Look at these familiar faces!

            Pony: Oh no.

            Willow: Pony, the ex-member. It's a shame you left us. You were a very good friend. It's too bad you are nothing to me now.

            Willow: (Player name), the officer who took me away from my family. Must've felt good to rip me away from the ones I care about, right?

            Willow: And who might you be? You are certainly someone I've never seen before.

            Zizzy: You may not know who I am, but I know everything about you and your sick crew.

            Willow: Is that so? I suppose Pony told you a lot about us, didn't he, sweetheart? That was one of his many flaws, heh. He could never keep his mouth shut.

            Willow: Hmm, what to do, what to do...? Ooh, I know! Take the zebra with us. Leave the two to rot.

            Pony: No, leave her alone!

            Willow: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses! I don't want to hurt anyone.

            Zizzy: It's okay, Pony. I'll stay safe and come back, I promise.

            Willow: See? She understands! Now, let's get out of here.

            Pony: Zizzy... They're the Silver Paw. When the infection broke out, I needed to find a group. Unfortunately, I was stuck with them. They did awful things, but I was too scared to leave.

            Player: What made you leave them?

            Pony: That's a story for another time. We need to go save Zizzy before it's too late.

            Player: Shouldn't we tell the others?

            Pony: There's no time, (Player name). I need you now. I can't do this alone.

            Player: Alright, let's follow them.

            Trivia
            For the hints MiniToon gave of Chapter 2, Book 2 one of them was a car (🚗) emoji. He gave a hint for a hole emoji, which looks like a manhole cover (🕳) and hints of a chain (⛓) emoji on a tweet he made.
            The Store is connected to the Metro, as seen on a wall by the spawn.
            Another thing to note is that it says Metro: Station 7. Metro is Chapter 7 in Piggy: Book 1, so this might also be a reference.
            If Pony is given a carrot, he will proceed to push a shelf out of the way to let the player pass.
            In the end cutscene when Mimi is talking to the person on the radio, Zee, one of Zizzy's sisters, is watching them.
            This is the second chapter that requires the player to give an item to an NPC rather than using the white key to escape, the first being Plant.
            This chapter currently has the longest ending cutscene.
            This is the only map where an NPC can be given two different items.
            If Zizzy is given two batteries, she will not take the grass.</p>
        <h2> Chapter 3 Refinery</h2>
        <p>Refinery is the third chapter of Piggy: Book 2 and the 15th chapter of Piggy overall. It was released on November 1st, 2020.

            Overview
            The Refinery was originally an oil rig called Lucella Oil Refinery, but was taken over by T.S.P (The Silver Paw).

            Cutscene
            The cutscene opens up with Pony and the Player arriving at T.S.P's base, which is a refinery. Pony warns the player to be careful as there are guards all around the building.

            After Pony and the Player find Zizzy, the group talks for a bit when Zizzy then reveals that she has suffered a scratch that is considered to be from an infected. She tells Pony and the Player to leave, and that it would not be safe with her around. The final cutscenes reveals Pony and Player returning to the safe house with Mimi, Giraffy, George, Zee, and Zuzy silently standing in memory of Zizzy.

            Prologue

            Player: So, this is where they took Zizzy. Have you been here before?

            Pony: No, I don't recognize this place at all... Either way, we can do this.

            (Round starts)

            Pony: Be careful, [Player name]! They must have guards everywhere in there.

            Pony: Got any carrots? I could easily get into this vent and make a distraction with one!

            Pony: If you can find a battery and open the door ahead, I can lead this guy away with this car I found in the vent!

            Epilogue

            Zizzy: Pony! [Player name]! It's so nice to see you again!

            Zizzy: You won't believe the amount of infected I've been knocked out today. I even started to enjoy doing it!

            Pony: Zizzy! I'm so relieved to know you're OK.

            Player: We should probably get out of here. They'll find out that something went wrong here sooner or later.

            Pony: You're right, we should definitely get out. Come on, Zizzy!

            Zizzy: Ah, hang on. I think I may have pulled a muscle.

            (Zizzy checks her arm to reveal a scratch.)

            Zizzy: Oh...

            Pony: That's not... that's not from an infected, is it?

            Zizzy: I...

            Zizzy: You two need to leave.

            Pony: We're not going anywhere without you. We can get you help!

            Zizzy: What help, Pony?

            Pony: We'll find a cure, we can save you!

            Zizzy: If there was a cure, we wouldn't even be here, Pony.

            Zizzy: You don't want to see me become one of them, so go.

            Zizzy: I'll create a distraction and sabotage as much as I can while you escape.

            Pony: Zizzy...

            (Pony and Zizzy hug.)

            Player: Take care, Zizzy.

            Zizzy: Good luck, you two. I'll miss you.

            The player and Pony return to the safe place.

            Trivia
            This is the third map the Player is losing a survivor in, the first being Forest, and the second being Metro.
            The hints that MiniToon gave out for Chapter 3 were a three emoji (3️⃣), an eye emoji (👁️), a cross or X emoji (❌), a footprint emoji (👣) and an exclamation mark (❕) on a Twitter post.
            This is T.S.P's base due to the sign reading, "Settlement Six" which is their undercover name.
            This has the second most bots of all chapters, even bypassing Plant that can have up to four bots.
            However, still Outpost has the most bots due to the many Soldiers.
            This is the only current chapter in Book 2 that Willow does not appear in.
            People think in the ending Poley is the infected who was beaten up by Zizzy (NPC).
            This is quite possible, since the infected in the room with her had Poley’s outfit.
            The number 6 on the Settlement 6 sign looks like a 5. MiniToon probably did this on purpose.
            If a player shoots one of the guard bots, the popup will say: "Piggy is gone for 20 seconds" while shooting the default Tigry bot will result as popup saying: "Tigry is gone for 20 seconds."</p>
        <h2> Chapter 4 The Safe House</h2>
        <p>he Safe Place is the fourth chapter of Piggy: Book 2 and the 16th chapter in the overall Piggy series. It's release date was originally supposed to be on November 18th or 19th, but was postponed to December 13th due to the chapter being buggy when tested, to the point that MiniToon felt he needed a break.

            Overview
            This chapter takes place in The Safe Place.

            The first floor is where is the final escape door and a unknown note is. The second floor is the radio room. The same from Mall - Chapter 10 and Store - Chapter 2 . The third floor is the café where you have to activate the elevator. The fourth floor is where Mimi's and Pony's room are located. The fifth floor where Zee & Zuzy, Zizzy, Giraffy, Georgie Piggy and the Player's rooms are located. This is also where the player and the bot Raze spawn. The building is heavily damaged by The Silver Paw.

            Cutscene
            The cutscene starts with Georgie waking up the player telling them to get out of the building because of it being raided. The player sleepily gets out of bed.

            After escaping, it turns out Willow and The Silver Paw were the masterminds behind the incident, which angers Georgie. Afterwards, the entire fraction of the survivors are captured by The Silver Paw, and are thrown into a jail cell until they "wear out", or cooperate.

            Georgie: "Come on, wake up already, (Player’s Name)! We need to get out of here!"

            Round Starts

            Georgie: "I don't know what that sound was, but I don't want to stick around to find out!"

            Once the room in which Giraffy is trapped gets unlocked:

            Giraffy: "Hey, thanks for letting me out, (Player’s Name)! If you find any grass, bring it, and I'll take out anything bothering you!"

            If the room in which Pony is trapped gets unlocked:

            Pony: "(Player’s Name)! I owe you a carrot sometime. Is everyone okay?"

            Pony enters Zee and Zuzy's room:

            Pony: "Huh, Zee and Zuzy aren't here. They must've used the vent up there, but it's sealed now. I hope they're safe..."

            If you extinguish the fire blocking the entrance to Mimi's room:

            Mimi: "Thanks, (Player’s Name)! Think you can help me find my key for this safe? What's inside will help us get out of here!"

            Willow: "I've been told that some of you caused quite a stir at one of our outposts."

            Pony: "How could you do this to us, Willow? You're destroying the home of many innocent people!"

            Willow: "And you really think you didn't do the same? How cute. The refinery was the home of many people, Pony."

            Willow: "You, the sleazy cop and that zebra have caused many relocations. We can't afford to feed them all in one place."

            Georgie: "Leave him alone! You took Zizzy away from us!"

            Willow: "Listen, kid. As much as I'd like to defend your friends' actions, they've done some horrible things to my people."

            Willow: "Take them with us. We'll keep them all in one place where we can control what they do."

            Giraffy: "You can't do this to us, we haven't done anything!"

            Trivia
            The hints that MiniToon gave for Chapter 4 were 4 emojis: an explosion (💥), a framed picture (🖼️), a fire (🔥), and a brick wall (🧱) .
            During November 29, 2020, he gave us 3 more emojis: another explosion (💥), some fog (🌫️), and a manhole (🕳️).
            KreekCraft predicted that Chapter 4 may involve the Safe Place getting burned or destroyed in some way.
            The first set of leaks were of the 5th floor of the hallway and the room where is Giraffy (NPC)'s room is.
            The final leak was of the staircase.
            The chapter has been delayed once; MiniToon stated on one tweet that he delayed it once, not twice.
            The image on the wall of the second leak shows forest in the end credits. A note can also be seen there says, "We'll miss you, Counselor G." The note is in Giraffy's room and is likely written by a camper and Counselor G is most likely Giraffy .
            Giraffy replaces Zizzy in this chapter.
            This is the first time Giraffy and Mimi can aid you in the map (Mimi helps with the exit and Giraffy will knock out Piggy for 20 seconds)
            MiniToon stated in a tweet that he added elevators as a special feature to the map, which are accessible to both Player and Piggy.
            This is the second chapter to have a title with more than one word, the first being Distorted Memory.
            However, this is the first permanent chapter to include more than one word in the title (excluding "The"), as Distorted Memory was available in the Piggy game for a limited amount of time.
            In the safe place, Player and Georgie share a bedroom, and so do Zee & Zuzy. Giraffy (NPC), Mimi (NPC), Pony (NPC), and Zizzy (NPC) have bedrooms of their own.
            This is the biggest map in Piggy: Book 2 so far.

            Overview
            It takes place in a sewer called the Lucella Sewer System with two floors, with the other floor being accessed by draining the sewage, multiple passageways, and rooms.

            Character
            The main bot antagonist is Alfis. He can place down Default Traps and will only chase players in his line of sight.

            Cutscene
            The cutscene starts with Zee and Zuzy popping out of a sewer grate, ready to free the fraction, however, only the player goes with them so that the T.S.P. guards do not get suspicious.

            The ending cutscene shows the player thanking the twins for helping them get the cell key. Back at the cell, the player uses it to unlock the cell, which Tigry notices. Willow also notices this and brings out her revolver shooting it saying that it is for William. She manages to land the bullet on Giraffy, which angers the player who has had enough of running from Willow. The two then duel each other as the cutscene is left off a cliffhanger.

            Intro
            Zuzy: Hey-o! I need someone to come down here and help us open this cell.

            Player: I'll go down there, you guys stay here so any guards don't get suspicious.

            In-game
            Player: "Let's get that cell open and all stop Willow together!"

            (When you enter the classroom and see the Eye)

            Player: "Can you guys hear the voices from the classroom? They're calling me... wait, why's there a classroom down here anyway?"

            (When you reach down near a vent with Zee & Zuzy.)

            Player: I think I see something shining in that vent. I will look for something that will help us reach in there."

            (You bring a mop and give it to Zuzy which she uses to get the White key.)

            Epilogue

            Zuzy: You go on ahead, Player. Zee and I need to go back to the safe place to get some things. Good luck stopping Willow!

            Player: Thank you, you two! Stay safe out there, and meet me outside of this place when you're back!

            (Scene cuts to the player opening the door to their friends prison).

            Player: Come on, everyone! Let's go!

            Pony: Where are Zee and Zuzy?

            Player: They'll meet us outside. We need to go now.

            (Player and their friends walk out of their cell down the hall. Tigry sees them and is about to throw a dagger at them before stopping. Willow appears behind him.)

            Willow: Useless tiger. Looks like I'm going to have to deal with them myself. This one's for you, William.

            (Willow aims her gun at Pony (NPC) and fires, but Giraffy takes the hit and falls to the ground.)

            Mimi: GIRAFFY!

            Giraffy: I-I hope this is...enough to forgive me for Zizzy...

            Pony: It's more then enough, Giraffy.

            Player: Get him out of here, do what you can do for him.

            (Player approaches Willow).

            Player: I'm tired of running, Willow. Let's settle this.

            Willow: With pleasure. Let's dance, darling.

            Trivia
            MiniToon said that the bot will have advanced mechanics rather than just chasing the players.
            Currently the Piggy bot can place down traps, but more mechanics will be added soon.
            He also said that it will be the scariest map yet.
            MiniToon also said on Twitter it will be another map built by IK3As.
            Willow most likely believes William is dead or infected due to her saying "This one's for you, William," before accidentally shooting Giraffy.
            She meant to shot Pony, but Giraffy jumped in to save him.
            Alfis only places default traps.
            However, Alfis's traps are taller than the default traps.
            This is the first map that Zee & Zuzy are given a major role in. Zee helps the player knock out Alfis/Piggy when fed grass, and Zuzy helps by getting the white key.
            Whispers can be heard through out the map. The source of this is being the white board in the room with the yellow safe.
            Whenever Zee is given grass and stuns the bot, it will say "Alfis will be back in 20 Seconds" instead of "(Piggy Name) is gone for 20 Seconds"
            There is a note referencing Mari.</p>
        <h2> Chapter 6 Factory (Mid Season Finale)</h2>
        <p>Factory is the sixth chapter of Piggy: Book 2, and the 18th chapter of Piggy overall. Its release date was originally set for February 14-15, but was postponed to 19th of the same month and again delayed to the 20th at 4:00 PM MST of the same month again due to Minitoon wanting to spend some time on developing the cutscenes of this chapter to perfect them.

            Overview
            The factory is a location taken over by The Silver Paw, and it is a cross between a jail cell and a factory. There are six T.S.P members trapped in different places.

            Cutscene
            The beginning cutscene starts with Willow standing in front of the player and Pony. Willow notices the manhole Zee & Zuzy popped out of. She then tells the blatantly obvious to the player and Pony that she is armed with a revolver and will give them a head start before she attempts to attack them.

            After escaping, the player and Pony find the T.S.P members they freed, Georgie Piggy, Mimi, and Giraffy. Willow confronts them all. Zee and Zuzy also arrive, which leads to Willow questioning who they are. Pony tells her that they are Zizzy's younger sisters and Willow took Zizzy away from them. Willow is terribly sorry for kidnapping Zizzy after she realized Zizzy had sisters. Mimi insists that Giraffy should rest, and the T.S.P members want to take care of Giraffy as thanks to the player for saving them. Now, Willow wants to cure Zizzy, but Georgie is skeptical of Willow's words. She tells the crew that the military is creating a cure. The player wants to ensure Willow will not betray them, and Willow tells the player she will go with them personally. Now, Georgie and the player trust Willow, but Pony still disbelieves her. After a long conversation, memories of a younger Willow being with William are shown.

            Prologue
            Willow, Player and Pony are all staring each other down. A loud crash is heard from the sewers.

            Willow: "Sounds like something is coming up from there. Doesn't sound too friendly to me."

            Willow: "On top of that, I've got a weapon. Not too fair, not very fun. I'll give you a head start. Your time starts now."

            (Willow fires her revolver at the ceiling and the round starts)

            Mid-round
            Pony: "We've got to stop her. Let's look around for something we can use!"

            After giving Pony a Wooden Sword
            Pony: "This should do the trick! Good thinking, [player's username]!"

            (Alternate dialogue) Pony: Aha, I've missed using one of these! Let's go get her!"

            Pony: "Great, it's broken! I never had this problem with my own before. There's gotta be more somewhere!"

            (Alternate dialogue) Pony: "Huh? It broke?! These must be for training... Hurry, let's find more!"

            Pony: "That's Willow taken care of! Let's get out of here and meet up with the others."

            (Alternate dialogue) Pony: "That one's for Zizzy! Now that Willow's dealt with, we should head for the others."

            (Secret dialouge) Pony: “I dont like this place, the whispers are even louder here. Let’s leave this awful place!”

            Saving the T.S.P Members
            Kitty: "Thanks for the help, but how'd all of these bricks just fall on me? We maintain this place well!"

            (Alternate dialogue) Kitty: "Gosh, that was painful! I was just minding my own business when this all fell on me!"

            Katie: "Phew, thanks for the help! I was handling these boxes with flammable substances in them, then something came in and started a fire!"

            Pandy: "This is the last time I'm on painting duty. I guess I misjudged you. Thanks."

            (Alternate dialogue) Pandy: "That was a close one, I don't think I could've held on any longer. Thank you."

            Filip: "Errr... don't ask me how I got stuck in here. Thanks for letting me out, though."

            (Alternate dialouge) Flilp: "Something- or someone- closed this crate on me and screwed it tight! Thanks for your help."

            Willow: "I had no idea... I'm.. sorry..."

            Mimi: "Giraffy's gonna be okay, but he should stay here for a bit... he needs rest."

            Katie: "We'll take care of him. It's our way of saying thanks."

            Pony: "How can we trust you?"

            Katie: "Today you showed us that we need to work together as survivors... otherwise we might as well be infected."

            Mimi: "They have the supplies here, as well!"

            Giraffy: "I'll be safe here with them, I promise."

            Willow: "I can save her."

            Katie: "How come we've never been told of this?"

            Willow: "I hid it from you because I vowed to find my brother William first.. if he was infected, I'd cure him. If he wasn't, we'd find safety."

            Willow: "I realize now that, no matter what, he's gone. And now, the zebra needs it... for her sisters. I don't want them to feel the way I did. No one should feel that way."

            Player: "How do we know this isn't a trap?"

            Willow: "I'll go with you personally. If I put you in any danger, well, you have my weapon. Do what you have to."

            Georgie: "I trust her. We all lost things... but this is a way for us to all get something back!"

            Player: "I agree. Let's set aside our differences and work together for a better future."

            Trivia
            This is the last chapter in Part 1 of Book 2, because after this, MiniToon will take a break from developing the game.
            A fan asked MiniToon about True Ending 2, and MiniToon said that Chapter 6 will have multiple endings, And that Book 2 Chapter 12 Will Have 3 Endings like Plant - Chapter 12.
            This would mean that Chapter 6 will be the second chapter to have more than one ending.
            However, the endings are based on gameplay instead of decision.
            MiniToon tweeted out a leak in 5 different emojis for this chapter which are an alarm emoji (🚨), an ambulance emoji (🚑), wolf emoji (🐺), fire emoji (🔥), and brick emoji (🧱).
            MiniToon also gave out more emojis, a mouse trap (🪤), a book (📖), and a flashlight (🔦).
            This is the 1st map to release skins with the same beginning letters, who are Katie and Kolie.
            MiniToon released the third leak of the chapter with a picture of Willow's revolver with saying "Will you make the right choices?"
            The three endings are named "Survivor ending", "Savior ending", and "Worst ending". They were leaked early before the actual chapter's release.
            To get the Survivor badge, the player needs to save some but not all T.S.P members.
            To get the Savior badge, the player needs to rescue all the T.S.P members.
            To get the Worst ending, the player must not save any of the T.S.P members.
            This is the only map where you cannot knock out the bot using a helpful NPC or gun (excluding Pony who only knocks out Willow).
            This is the second map to have an non-canon ending, the first being Plant with the Good and Bad Endings.
            This is the first map where if you use a key, it will disappear from the inventory</p>
        <h1> Game Modes </h1>
        <h2> Player </h2>
        <p>Player is one of the basic gamemodes in Piggy.

            Overview
            In this gamemode, a Player plays the role of Piggy. Before the round starts, the game will randomly to select a player in the voting screen to be Piggy. The player Piggy is armed with whatever trap that player has equipped, and uses the skin that player has equipped. Like any Piggy, a player Piggy cannot crawl under vents. You can add traps, catch all players before time's up!

            Trivia
            A player Piggy can avoid certain obstacles that players cannot (e.g. acid, bear traps, etc.).
            For maps with two bots (one main and one extra), the player piggy will only replace the bot piggy; the extra bot will still be controlled by CPU.
            A player has a 2x chance to be picked with the 2x Piggy Chance gamepass.</p>
        <h2> Bot</h2>
        <p>Bot gamemode is one of the basic game modes.

            Bot.PNG
            10bots.png
            Overview
            In this gamemode, a CPU-controlled bot plays the role of Piggy. This, there is no need for the selection of a Player to be Piggy. A bot Piggy does not have bear traps, so they cannot place any. Like any Piggy, bots cannot crawl under vents. In 100 Player Piggy, instead of having 1 bot, 10 bots will be used instead making it a bit harder.

            Trivia
            A bot Piggy is coded to move towards the nearest player to attack them.
            Players often use this to confuse the bot by having two players being the same distance from Piggy. This may cause the bot to get stuck into a loop.
            Each chapter has an assigned bot skin.
            Some chapters, such as City - Chapter 9, have an extra bot.
            Bots, along with Helpful NPCs, take about three seconds to open a door, whereas a player as a piggy can open a door instantly.
            Bot can pass through the doors when they open it, when the player can't.
            Every Piggy bot (excluding Zompiggy and Memory) with the long dress will have their head tilted and their arms would be raised slightly. This can help identify if Piggy is a bot if you just joined.
            The bot skin used to be Little Brother, for chapters, House, Station, Gallery and Forest. But now, there are unique assigned bot skins.
            Book 2 Chapter 5/Chapter 17 will have a different Bot mechanic.
            This was revealed that the bot can place traps.
            The Bot gamemode is selected if there is one player voting, regardless of what gamemode they voted for.</p>
        <h2> Infection </h2>
        <p>Infection is a special gamemode added to Piggy when it reached 500 million visits.

            The game is just player mode but when a player dies, they become a self-selected Piggy skin and help the Piggy kill the remaining players. The more people that die, the more piggies there are and the fewer players there are. There is a con to the Piggy players though as they have no bear traps

            Trivia
            This is currently the only gamemode and map to have more than 3 piggies (the record was originally held in the forest map with player + bot gamemode having 3 piggies (The Player, Bot and Doggy).
            This mode was originally going to be in the game for a short period of time, but a twitter poll by MiniToon made it stay, with "yes" winning the poll.
            Infection is a mode that only appears every other round.
            Infection is the first mode that doesn't have a Piggy Family skin on its picture, the second is Traitor (with the Player's silhouette).
            Howeover if you look closely theres a shadow of piggy and little brother.
            This is one of the first game modes to be harder. The second is Player + Bot.
            If a player using the Torcher skin is chosen to be Piggy in Infection and manages to catch a player, the player first dies before becoming a Piggy.</p>
        <h2> Traitor </h2>
        <p>Traitor is a gamemode that came on the 1 Billion visits update.

            Walk
            The players must avoid the traitor in disguise, which is unknown to the players. The traitor must secretly place traps and kill players to avoid getting shot. However, Piggy can kill the traitor and be shot by weapons.

            The traitor automatically starts the game with traps, and after one minute, (or when the timer hits 8:59) they're able to gain a knife. They can hold any item except weapons (other than their knife).

            How Player Wins
            The Players win if they either kill the Traitor, the Traitor gets caught by Piggy, or if the players escape the map.
            How Traitor Wins
            The Traitor wins by either escaping the map, or killing all of the Players.

            Trivia
            This is the fifth Piggy game mode to be added in the game.
            This gamemode is playable in intervals, sharing place with Infection. The gamemode choice switches with each round.
            The traitor gets an intro cutscene that's a lot different from the usual cutscene.
            For some reason, the cutscene's music in the background is silent, so you'll know if it's you.
            Also, the Traitor cutscene is actually located in the main menu screen at the very back, proven by a glitch that a user encountered.
            Because of confusion by new players, the round often goes very quickly due to the Traitor getting killed by the bot or the rest of the players get killed by the bot.
            It's mainly because new players are more focused on the other players than the bot, Chapters: Gallery, School, Metro, Carnival, Plant, and the limited-time map Distorted Memory are considered be traitor in due to the gun (crossbow in the case of Metro) being easy to access straight away.
            For Gallery, the gun spawns on one of the tables in the dinosaur skeleton room.
            In School, it spawns in the Science classroom on one of the bookshelves.
            In Metro, the crossbow has always spawned near Bunny.
            In Carnival, the blue key unlocks the area with the purple safe and the purple key sometimes spawns close to the safe.
            In Plant, the keycards can access both rooms quickly to get the gun.
            In Distorted Memory, the safe and purple key can be found easily.
            That said, any other maps without a gun and ammo will get those, as proven with School and others.
            Traitor is a role that functions parallel to Murderer, a similar role in Murder Mystery 2.
            Traitor was going to be easier because of the bot not chasing the Traitor. This would've made it easier for the traitor or making it easier for players to see who the traitor is.
            This means the bot will chase and can kill the traitor. Be wary when killing somebody, as the animation give the bot time to easily kill you.
            The traitor's knife and kill animation are the same as Foxy's.
            Traitor mode was first added onto private servers only, later, MiniToon finally added the mode into public servers.
            If an innocent player is shot wrongly by a gun, the player will turn into Piggy
            The Piggy Tokens (double with 2x piggy coins gamepass), the same as piggy does.
            The traitor also plays a role similar to piggy, but as a player, meaning they can crouch and run fast, The traitor will often be camping the safe that includes the gun, making it easier to find out who the traitor is (and also a player would yell out in the chat who it is (sometimes)).
            Traitor is one of the most hated modes in Piggy.
            If the traitor dies by the bot, everyone except the traitor gets 5 piggy-tokens.
            This gamemode could possibly be like Among Us, a game made before Piggy.
            Overall, this is the most unique gamemode in Piggy.
            When you are a survivor, you will be given the intro cutscene of the chapter selected.
            If a person shoots the traitor, you will gain more piggy tokens. (Like Murder Mystery 2)
            If the bot is following the traitor, and the traitor kills someone, the bot is known to glitch out and freeze in place.</p>

            General Gameplay
            Piggy: Intercity is an open world game with various locations from the original Piggy game.
            You start by creating your character and spawning in a safe zone, which has a shop and a few friendly characters.
            Once outside the safe zone, you will have to fight several infected that spawn all over the map.
            Areas like Forest, School and Mall from the original Piggy are in the game and can be visited.
            You can find weapons to defend yourself with or food and water to keep your hunger and thirst meters at bay.
            You have four inventory slots in-game. Items are stackable (maxing out at 256) and take up one inventory slot.
            If you let your hunger & thirst bar lower, then you will lose 40 HP for each bar, making your HP at maximum 20.
            When attacked by an infected, you have a chance to catch the infection.
            If you do, a yellow meter with a biohazard symbol will appear below your three other meters.
            Once it reaches zero, your character goes down on its knees and turns infected.
            Character Creator
            Players are able to use the character creator to customize their appearance.
            There are three slots available for this.
            Inside the character creator, there are options to choose animal heads (which are used to determinate skin color), upper body clothing and lower body clothing.
            The last two are also able to be changed in color.
            One is also able to change their infected pupil colors by changing the secondary color of the upper body clothing.
            Currently the animal heads consist of a dog, a donkey, an orange cat, a panda, a black cat, a fox, a zebra, a pig, a raccoon, a bear, a giraffe, a mole, a horse, a rabbit, an elephant and a mouse.
            There are no hats in the character creator so far. They will most likely come out in future updates.

            Trivia
            The game will soon have secrets, exploring, more gears, and levels. There will also be Story Quests, Side Quests, and Interactions with NPCs
            Iamsrauf1 is helping MiniToon make the game.
            The skin creator is quite similar to the one in "APRP: The Return (DEMO)", a Piggy roleplay game made by TenuousFlea.
            Iamsrauf1 posted a picture on Twitter of her character (Zebby) holding the Red Bat, a developer-only weapon.
            HannahB458, the Mr. P model developer, helped make the gun models for Piggy: Intercity.
            BSlick helped to make the Official Soundtrack for Piggy: Intercity.
            There will be lots of lore to help you find out when it takes place.
            If you go to the Carnival, you can actually see it as a re-designed Carnival now. The Mr. P fences are now purple to match Mr. P's new redesigned skin/NPC/character.
            This is the map in Piggy: Intercity that got the biggest redesign so far. The Forest got the second biggest redesign, which completely changes the pathways to look more smooth.
            Piggy: Intercity may be the fastest game on Roblox to reach 1 million visits, making it reach 4 million at the end of the day the game was released.
            There are some secret Survivor NPCs located around the map, like at the beach, beside a mountain, or in the Safe Place.
            It's currently in the DEMO phase, and more updates are coming soon.
            When you die and reach 0 health, you respawn in the Medical tent back at the base with your weapons. But, your food, water, gasoline, and all kinds of ammunition disappear.
            The building with the most food and water is Elly Enterprises. Check upstairs, and there will be a lot of food and water.
            MiniToon confirmed that an update for the game would come in March, including new locations, side quests, story quests, hats, clothing, species, items, and much more.
            However, it will take him about a week to brainstorm it.
            The item stack limit of 256 is possibly a reference to how old-school computers could only hold 256 values.
            However, this is possibly just a coincidence.</p>
